Several older source files were contributed to dbus without explicitly
specifying a license or a copyright holder. A reasonable assumption is
that those files are probably intended to be licensed under
"AFL-2.1 OR GPL-2.0-or-later".

Other projects wishing to reuse those source files should do whatever
level of legal checking and research they consider to be appropriate.
